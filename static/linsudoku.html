 This is a sudoku helper/solver. What it does is
 it uses a simple logical algorithm to find the where
 to place the numbers.<br /><br />
 It also checks for a valid input.<br /><br />
 Writing 0(zero) deletes a placed number and a
 number can be replaced just by writing another
 in its place.<br /><br />
 It uses curses and thus it's consol based so I haven't
 spend much time for interface design.<br />
 So no mouse support, sorry.<br /><br />
 To build simply extract the archive and run 
 'make release'.
