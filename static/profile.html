<h1>About Katana Steel</h1>
<div>
    Hi there, the name's Rene but I go by Katana I've been writing software for more than 15 years.
    Starting with simple D&amp;D tools in Word Basic to generate game character sheets.<br/>
    And as many a teenager I wanted to create VideoGames and got into C and C++.<br/>
    What I can share is on github.com or gitlab.com (user: Katana-Steel for both).<br/>
    Lately I've been getting into some game dev first by starting to make the lithtech game engine to build on Linux, then onto some of my own work using Godot.

    With my first IT job I got into PHP and QT to create a 
    <a href="https://github.com/Katana-Steel/CRM_Unity" target="_blank">simple CRM System</a>
    from scratch building from requirement to requirement, a sort of BDD or FDD(feature drivent development).<br/>
    Since 2012 I've been an ops engineer at Touchcommerce then Nuance and now Microsoft.<br/>
    I have been working in operations for more than 10 years and now looking to get into more of a dev role.<br/>

    Recently I've started tinkering with the defunct/abandoned 
    <a href="https://github.com/Katana-Steel/lithtech" target="_blank">game enging LithTech</a>
    with the hope that at somepoint I can play the game F.E.A.R. naitively on my OS of choice.<br/>
    By finishing up the migration of 
    <a href="https://docs.xfce.org/apps/xfburn/start" target="_blank">xfburn</a>
    to GTK+3 framework I've also taken up maintenance of this project, which is distibuted with
    pretty much all the Linux distributions that ships the 
    <a href="https://www.xfce.org/" target="_blank">XFCE desktop</a>.<br/>
    My first Godot project is a <a href="https://gitlab.com/Katana-Steel/lunar-lander" target="_blank">Lunar Lander</a> clone that is automatically build with
    gitlab pipelines and released to <a href="https://katana-steel.itch.io/lunarlander" target="_blank">itch.io</a>.
