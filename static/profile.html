<h1>About Katana Steel</h1>
<div>
    I started learning BASIC at 13 on my own and from library book.
    From there I've been writing software since I was 16. 
    Starting with simple D&amp;D tools in Word Basic to generate game character sheets.<br/>
    And as many a teenager I wanted to create VideoGames and got into C and C++.<br/>
    With my first IT job I got into PHP and QT to create a 
    <a href="https://github.com/Katana-Steel/CRM_Unity" target="_blank">simple CRM System</a>
    from scratch building from requirement to requirement, a sort of BDD or FDD(feature drivent development).

    Recently I've started tinkering with the defunct/abandoned 
    <a href="https://github.com/Katana-Steel/lithtech" target="_blank">game enging LithTech</a>
    with the hope that at somepoint I can play the game F.E.A.R. naitively on my OS of choice.<br/>
    By finishing up the migration of 
    <a href="https://docs.xfce.org/apps/xfburn" target="_blank">xfburn</a>
    to GTK+3 framework I've also taken up maintenance of this project, which is distibuted with
    pretty much all the Linux distributions that ships the 
    <a href="https://www.xfce.org/" target="_blank">XFCE desktop</a>.
